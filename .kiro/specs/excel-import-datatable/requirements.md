# Requirements Document

## Introduction

엑셀 가져오기 페이지에서 사용자가 엑셀 파일을 업로드한 후, 기존 order 테이블의 데이터를 확인할 수 있도록 DataTable 컴포넌트를 추가하는 기능입니다. 이를 통해 사용자는 새로 가져온 데이터와 기존 데이터를 비교하고 검토할 수 있습니다.

4. WHEN the table has column filters THEN the system SHALL provide dropdown filters for categorical data columns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to sort the order data by different columns, so that I can organize the information according to my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN I click on the same column header again THEN the system SHALL sort the data in descending order
3. WHEN I click on a different column header THEN the system SHALL sort by the new column and reset the previous sort
4. WHEN a column is sorted THEN the system SHALL display a visual indicator (arrow) showing the sort direction

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize the table view and export data, so that I can work with the data according to my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the DataTable THEN the system SHALL provide column visibility toggle options
2. WHEN I want to export data THEN the system SHALL provide export functionality for filtered/selected data
